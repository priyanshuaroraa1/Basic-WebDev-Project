                    <h3>Transition to university</h3>
                    <p>
                        All our group members have transitioned directly
                        from upper secondary school to university.
                        In our situation, this has been both beneficial
                        and very challenging. The pandemic made our last semester
                        in upper secondary class remarkably different. The curriculum
                        was delayed and pushed forward time and time again.
                        The exchange between physical and digital lessons were also
                        irregular.  
                    </p>   
                    
                    <p>
                        The benefits were that we got used to alternating
                        between physical and digital lessons. The downside was
                        that it was easy to be lazy, and that made the whole transition
                        even more demanding. In the beginning of the semester we
                        started slow, but we quickly pickked up the pace.
                        In order to keep up with the curriculum we had to be consistent 
                        with our work.

                    <h3>Managing the workload</h3>
                    <p>
                        For some of us it has been quite draining especially 
                        since the workload has significantly increased. 
                        In upper secondary school we were used to a mix of online and
                        physical lessons. Now several of our subjects are completely
                        online, thus we are not followed up on our work like were used to.
                        Even though we have contact with our teachers through lessons
                        and obligatory assignments we don’t have the same one on one
                        relation with our teachers. Unlike before, we are now expected
                        to do most of the work by ourselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The university has made
                        sure to put in place quite a few obligatory assignments to make
                        sure we work evenly across our semester. It is estimated that we
                        work 8 hours a day with our subject, since it is a full- time study.
                        Most subjects have three to four obligatory assignments throughout
                        a semester. Multiplying this with our four subjects, we quickly
                        have 15 + assignments in one semester. Most of these assignments
                        are quite challenging and time consuming. We were able to cut
                        the workload down since we work in groups, but it was still a
                        challenge to make time to work on the same project even
                        though we have different things to work on.
                        Considering many of us also have a part-time job, it has been 
                        strenuous to balance work and school.

                    <h3>Facing new challenges</h3>
                    <p>
                        We realized that we had to be consistent with all our work to be
                        able to prepare ourselves for our exams. It is difficult to have
                        the discipline to set aside time for schoolwork as most of it was
                        self-learning from home. It has been challenging to keep up with
                        all the work since there is a lot of new things. In our programming
                        subject we learned a completely new programming language. In upper
                        secondary school we were taught JavaScript, but now we are using 
                        Java.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Contrary to what we assumed the two languages do not share 
                        similarities. It is almost as learning two completely different 
                        languages. In other subjects such as Web development we were 
                        introduced to new methods that were advanced and more structurally
                        correct. There were a lot of bad habits that we carried from what
                        we had learned earlier, which was a challenging temptation.
                        Using elements such as “float” and “br” was acceptable in upper
                        secondary school, but we quickly realized that these were things
                        we absolutely had to refrain from going forward.
