                    <h3>Innovation in the digital city:</h3>
                    <p>
                    Innovation is something that happens around the world every
                    single day. To innovate something new, you usually must 
                    think outside the box, but in some cases, events that happen 
                    around the world change the way people think, and we must innovate 
                    in new ways based on these events. “Now and then a new technology 
                    brings about profound of societal changes” (Geirbo). An example 
                    of this could be the <a class="linkDecoration" href="https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/" target="blank">corona pandemic</a>, where masks, corona certificates 
                    and self-tests were introduced to individuals. Had anybody really thought 
                    of these things before the pandemic?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    It is because of this we need to think about the long run and prepare
                    for problems that may arise in the future. One non existing job our
                    group thought of was <a class="linkDecoration"

                    <p>
                        It is incredibly important that in the future we can offer 
                        solutions for sustainable food systems. Professor Cribb, in 
                        his book 
                        <a class="linkDecoration" 
                        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287516649_The_Coming_Famine_the_Global_Food_Crisis_and_What_We_Can_Do_to_Avoid_It" 
                        target="blank">“The Coming Famine:</a> The Global Food Crisis and What 
                        We Can Do To Avoid It”
                        , writes that due to shortages of water, 
                        land and energy combined with increased demand will create a global 
                        food shortage around the year 2050 (The World Counts, u.d.). With 
                        better handling of our acres and with newer technology we can be 
                        able to produce food which is more cost-efficient. 
                        (The World Counts, u.d.) According to the MIT university in India, 
                        advancement in food technology could reduce diseases, and improve the 
                        quality of food. Alongside this we might get better prevention techniques 
                        and less wastage of food. (MITUniversity, 2020). Another positive side of 
                        this technology is that we might be able to customize the food we eat with 
                        more <a class="linkDecoration"

                        way it will be easier for us to eat healthier and customize our diet with 
                        the right food.
